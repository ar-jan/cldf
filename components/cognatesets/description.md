# Cognate sets

In historical linguistics cognate judgements have often been postulated as complete set,
not based on justifications for invidual cognates. Thus, the requirement arises to 
encode data related to cognate sets.

The default description of the cognateset table is available in 
[`CognatesetTable-metadata.json`](CognatesetTable-metadata.json).
